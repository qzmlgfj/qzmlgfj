## Who's this guy

A lazy dog from a second-rate university, CS student.

But now a CRUD boyðŸ˜­.

## Interests

* Front-end development, just a beginner.
* Making gadgets.
* Writing something in my personal [blog](https://blog.antrol.xyz/).

<!--
* Try to develop a website for [Anime4KCPP](https://github.com/TianZerL/Anime4KCPP).
* Develop a Markdown renderer which user can customize its css, of course it is GUI-based.~~(If I could finish  it before getting bored)~~
* Work with my [teammates](https://github.com/SWJTU-Lazy-Dogs).
