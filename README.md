# qzmlgfj

## Who's this guy

A lazy dog of SWJTU, undergraduate student.

## Interests

* Enjoy creating new projects and repositories, but never finish them.
* Front-end development, just a beginner.
* Making gadgets.
* Writing something in my personal [blog](https://qzmlgfj.ml/blog).

## Recent plans

* Try to develop a website for [Anime4KCPP](https://github.com/TianZerL/Anime4KCPP).
* Upload my internship, a **driver for VL53L1X**, a TOF sensor.~~(If I could make it much easier to understand)~~
* Develop a Markdown renderer which user can customize its css, of course it is GUI-based.~~(If I could finish  it before getting bored)~~
* Work with my [teammates](https://github.com/SWJTU-Lazy-Dogs).
* Find something interests me, as a hobby after finishing my ~~boring~~ homework.

*I have uploaded an **I2C driver for FPGA**, ALTERA EP4CE6E22C8 in a private repository, but because of my teacher's warning, I decided to publish it until this internship is finished completely.*
